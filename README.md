CMDocument

A Configuration Management Database that aims to also easily provide detailed documentation into the mix.

This project intends to replace spreadsheets and wiki's for Data Center Documentation.

This will provide the ability to define and document any number of objects in a Data Center Environment, including switches, racks, wireless devices, and virtual hardware.

This project will also provide a means to automate warranty status tables by vendor and serial number by accessing APIs.
